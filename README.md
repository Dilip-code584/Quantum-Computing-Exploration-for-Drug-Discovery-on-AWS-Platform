# Quantum Computing Exploration for Drug Discovery on AWS

## Overview

**Quantum Computing Exploration for Drug Discovery on AWS** is an open-source solution that allows researchers and quantum computing advocates to design and run computational studies in the field of drug discovery.

With this solution, you can access quantum computers via the **Amazon Braket** service. The **Amazon Braket Hybrid Job** feature allows you to use both classical and quantum computing resources to evaluate experiment values such as **cost, time, and performance**.

The solution comes with **built-in sample code** for certain drug discovery problems, such as:

* Molecular docking
* Protein folding
* RNA folding
* Retrosynthetic planning

This helps you get started with quantum computing in the field of drug discovery.

The overall architecture is shown below:

For a detailed description of the architecture, refer to the **[Architecture Page]**.

This solution deploys an **Amazon CloudFormation template** in your AWS Cloud account and provides the URL for **Notebook Experiments** about drug discovery problems.
